    <p>Staff Selection Commission - Combined Graduate Level Examination, often referred to as SSC CGL is an examination conducted to recruit staff to various posts in ministries, departments and organisations of the Government of India. It is conducted by the Staff Selection Commission for selecting staff for various Group B and Group C posts. The Staff Selection Commission was established in 1975</p>
    <p>Candidates applying for the various posts need to have a bachelor's degree from a recognised university at the time of applying. The age requirements are between 20 and 30 years. The age limits may vary depending on the position applied. For instance, the position for Inspector of Central Bureau of Narcotics which had an age range from 18 to 27 years, was extended to 30 years in September 2018. The application fee for 2017 is Rs. 100. All women candidates and candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Physically Handicapped, and Ex-Servicemen eligible for reservation are exempted from paying application fee.</p>
    <p>The examination has several Tiers which are conducted over different days with results posted after each Tier. Previous exams also included an interview tier, but following a government order, interviews have been dispensed off for all non-gazetted posts in the central government as of 1 January 2016. A computer proficiency test or a skill test was also added as a Tier for some posts. There are four major tiers for the 2018 exam.</p>
    <p>The 2016 exam was held in 44 batches across 96 cities. There were 3.8 million applicants, of which 1.48 million took the Tier 1 exam. 149,319 candidates passed Tier 1, and 35,096 candidates passed Tier 2. The final number of positions for the 2016 exam was estimated to be about 10,661.

        Candidates were allowed to view their answer sheets and point out errors in the grading of answers for a fee of Rs. 100 per question.
        
        For the 2017 exam, the SSC said about 3,026,598 candidates filled in the online application, of which 1,543,418 candidates took the exam. 226,229 candidates passed Tier 1, and 47,003 candidates passed Tier 2.</p>

    <p>On 21 February 2018, it was reported that the screenshots of the question paper of the 2017 SSC Tier 2 exam appeared on social media before the exam began. This led to massive protests. The authorities canceled the exam, and Central Bureau of Investigation conducted an investigation, releasing a First information report that named several entities including employees at Sify Technologies that allegedly participated in the leak. The Tier 3 exam for that year was also postponed</p>
    <p>Postponements in exam dates and/or results have been a regular occurrence. In addition to the delays in launching the 2017 Tier 1 exams, the 2016 exam final appointments were delayed. The 2014 exam was also delayed and the 2018 Tier 1 exams are being postponed.</p>

Three of the songs were written by August von Trapp. In 2014 it was awarded a silver certification from the Independent Music Companies Association, which indicated sales of at least 20,000 copies throughout Europe</p>
    <p>The larger ocean-going cruise ships that visit the port currently dock at the Pinkenba Wharf, located on the north side of the Brisbane River, north of the Gateway Bridge, due to height restrictions placed by the bridge.

        Until the establishment of the new Portside Wharf at Hamilton, Australian cruise ship company P&O Cruises used the Pinkenba wharf as a base for its cruise ships, "Pacific Sky" and "Pacific Star". The Brisbane dock is not particularly glamorous, and is mainly used by industrial vessels.
        
        Correspondingly the Queensland Government is under pressure to create a new second international cruise terminal for Brisbane on the northern side of the Gateway Bridge to accommodate the larger ocean-going cruise ships. A February 2008 visit by the luxury cruise ship the MS Queen Victoria meant that passengers could not use the international standard cruise terminal facilities at Portside Wharf and had to use the industrial wharf complex at Pinkenba instead.</p>

    <p>Art means to put everything in its right place. That is, the art of listening is to listen to what is said without comparing it with what already you know. If you compare what you listen to, you distort it. You have already accepted the old, and you put the new into the old bottle. So can you listen without comparing or translating, but actually listen to the words, meaning, and significance? Can you listen without saying the Gita, the Upanishads or some other book says that? Absolute listening is very difficult for most people because they have never learnt the art of listening. Listen to those crows. Don’t resist but listen with your heart. Listen to the words, the meaning of the words and the significance behind the words, and thereby have an insight into what is being said. Insight is not that you intellectually understand or verbally comprehend what is being said, because truth is something that lies beyond the word. This is the art of listening.</p>
    <p>Then there is the art of seeing. We see things through the picture we have created about it. When you look at a tree, you don’t look at the tree; you look through the word and image you have about the tree—the same when you look at a person. You are sitting looking at me. Are you looking at me through the image you have built—the reputation, the knowledge that you have about me or what I have said? If you have no image or conclusions about the speaker, you are observing actually what is, not the name and the form, but behind that, what actually is. That is the art of seeing, observing.</p>
